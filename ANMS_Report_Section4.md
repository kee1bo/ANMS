JavaScript ES6+ handles client-side interactions, form validation, and API communication through a modular architecture supporting progressive enhancement.

The application layer utilizes PHP 8.2+ for server-side processing, implementing RESTful API design patterns with proper HTTP methods and status codes. The API bridge (api-bridge.php) serves as the central routing mechanism, handling authentication, request validation, and response formatting. Session management combines traditional PHP sessions with JWT token authentication, providing both security and scalability. Input validation and sanitization occur at multiple levels, preventing SQL injection, XSS attacks, and other security vulnerabilities.

The data layer employs SQLite as the primary database with a comprehensive schema supporting users, pets, health records, and nutrition plans. Foreign key constraints ensure referential integrity, while proper indexing optimizes query performance. A file storage fallback system provides redundancy and ensures system availability even during database issues. The database schema includes four core tables: users table storing authentication and profile information, pets table containing comprehensive animal profiles, health_records table tracking medical and wellness data, and nutrition_plans table managing dietary recommendations.

### 4.2 Core System Components

#### 4.2.1 User Management System

The user management system provides comprehensive authentication and authorization capabilities. User registration implements secure password hashing using PHP's password_hash() function with bcrypt algorithm, email validation with proper format checking, and duplicate prevention through database constraints. The registration process creates user accounts with first name, last name, email, and securely hashed passwords, automatically establishing user sessions upon successful registration.

Authentication mechanisms support both traditional session-based and modern JWT token approaches. The login process validates credentials against hashed passwords, establishes secure sessions with appropriate timeout settings, and generates JWT tokens for API access. Session management includes automatic cleanup, secure cookie handling, and protection against session fixation attacks. Logout functionality properly destroys sessions and invalidates tokens, ensuring complete security cleanup.

Profile management allows users to update personal information, change passwords with proper validation, and manage account preferences. Role-based access control foundations support future expansion to include veterinary professionals and administrative users, with clear permission boundaries and capability restrictions.

#### 4.2.2 Pet Profile Management

The pet profile management system enables comprehensive animal information tracking with extensive data validation and user-friendly interfaces. Pet creation supports multiple species including dogs, cats, and other common pets, with breed-specific information and characteristics. The system captures essential data including name, species, breed, age, current weight, ideal weight, activity level, health status, and personality notes.

Data validation ensures information accuracy through type checking, range validation for numerical values, and species-appropriate constraints. The pet profile interface provides intuitive forms with real-time validation feedback, helping users enter accurate information while preventing common errors. Photo management capabilities allow users to upload and display pet images, with automatic optimization and secure storage handling.

CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) provide complete pet management functionality with proper error handling and user feedback. The pet listing interface displays animals in an organized grid layout with filtering and sorting capabilities. Individual pet profiles show comprehensive information with edit capabilities and health tracking integration.

#### 4.2.3 Health Tracking System

The health tracking system implements comprehensive monitoring capabilities for pet wellness management. Weight logging functionality allows users to record regular weight measurements with date stamps, creating historical trends and identifying patterns. The system calculates weight changes, tracks progress toward ideal weight goals, and provides visual representations through charts and graphs.

Health record management supports multiple record types including weight measurements, medication tracking, veterinary visits, vaccinations, and general health notes. Each record includes structured data fields, free-text notes, and proper categorization for easy retrieval and analysis. The system maintains complete audit trails with creation timestamps and modification history.

Visual data representation employs JavaScript charting libraries to display health trends, weight progression, and other metrics in user-friendly formats. Interactive charts allow users to explore data across different time periods and identify significant changes or patterns. Export capabilities enable users to generate reports for veterinary consultations, supporting professional healthcare integration.

#### 4.2.4 Database Integration and Performance

The SQLite database implementation provides robust data persistence with ACID compliance and proper transaction handling. The database schema employs normalized design principles, reducing redundancy while maintaining query performance through strategic indexing. Foreign key constraints ensure referential integrity, preventing orphaned records and maintaining data consistency.

Query optimization techniques include proper index usage, prepared statements for security and performance, and efficient JOIN operations for related data retrieval. The system implements connection pooling concepts and resource management to handle concurrent users effectively. Database backup and recovery procedures ensure data protection and business continuity.

Performance monitoring tracks query execution times, database size growth, and system resource utilization. The implementation achieves sub-2-second response times for standard operations, meeting established performance criteria. Scalability considerations include database partitioning strategies and migration paths to more robust database systems as user base grows.

### 4.3 Technical Implementation Details

#### 4.3.1 Security Implementation

Security measures permeate all system layers, implementing defense-in-depth principles. Input validation occurs at both client and server sides, preventing malicious data entry and ensuring data integrity. SQL injection prevention uses prepared statements exclusively, parameterizing all database queries and eliminating direct string concatenation vulnerabilities.

Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) protection includes output encoding, Content Security Policy headers, and input sanitization. Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) protection implements token validation for state-changing operations. Session security includes secure cookie settings, proper session timeout handling, and protection against session hijacking attempts.

Authentication security employs strong password hashing, secure session management, and protection against brute force attacks through rate limiting. Authorization mechanisms ensure users can only access their own data, with proper permission checking throughout the application. Security headers including X-Content-Type-Options, X-Frame-Options, and X-XSS-Protection provide additional browser-level protection.

#### 4.3.2 API Design and Implementation

The RESTful API design follows industry best practices with proper HTTP methods, status codes, and resource naming conventions. GET requests retrieve data without side effects, POST requests create new resources, PUT requests update existing resources, and DELETE requests remove resources. Consistent JSON response formats include success indicators, data payloads, and error messages.

Error handling provides meaningful feedback to clients while protecting sensitive system information. HTTP status codes accurately reflect operation results: 200 for success, 400 for client errors, 401 for authentication failures, 404 for not found resources, and 500 for server errors. Error responses include user-friendly messages and, where appropriate, guidance for resolution.

API versioning considerations prepare for future enhancements while maintaining backward compatibility. Request and response logging support debugging and monitoring, while rate limiting prevents abuse and ensures fair resource allocation among users.

#### 4.3.3 Frontend Implementation and User Experience
