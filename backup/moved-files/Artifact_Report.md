## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Context and Problem Statement

Animal nutrition represents a critical factor in maintaining health, welfare, and longevity across millions of animals in domestic, agricultural, and shelter environments. Despite significant advances in nutritional science, a substantial implementation gap exists between sophisticated research findings and practical application by caregivers. This gap manifests across multiple dimensions: knowledge accessibility, recommendation personalization, monitoring integration, and educational support.

The global animal nutrition market, valued at USD 24.26 billion in 2023 and projected to reach USD 42.48 billion by 2032, reflects growing demand for precision nutrition solutions (Newstrail, 2025). However, current digital tools remain fragmented, serving either basic consumer needs with generic recommendations or professional requirements with complex, expensive systems requiring specialized training.

Modern animal nutrition science recognizes that optimal feeding strategies must account for multiple interacting factors creating highly individualized requirements. Research demonstrates that precision nutrition approaches can improve health outcomes by up to 35% compared to traditional population-based strategies (Verschoor et al., 2023). Yet implementing such sophisticated approaches requires knowledge and computational systems typically beyond most caregivers' reach.

## 4. Artefact Development and Implementation

This section details the practical implementation of the Animal Nutrition Management System (ANMS), translating the methodological framework into a functional, user-centric web application. It covers the key development stages, from database design to the final user interface, and provides insight into the technical decisions made throughout the process.

### 4.1 Database Design and Implementation

The foundation of the ANMS is its robust and scalable database. A relational database model was chosen to ensure data integrity and to efficiently manage the complex relationships between users, pets, foods, and health records.

**[Placeholder for ERD Diagram: A detailed Entity-Relationship Diagram of the ANMS database, showing tables, columns, and relationships.]**

The database schema consists of several key tables:

*   **`users`:** Stores user account information, including authentication credentials and user roles (e.g., pet owner, veterinarian).
*   **`pets`:** Contains detailed profiles for each animal, including species, breed, age, weight, activity level, and any specific health conditions.
*   **`foods`:** A comprehensive library of food items with detailed nutritional information (e.g., calories, protein, fat, vitamins, minerals).
*   **`diet_plans`:** Stores the generated diet plans, linking users, pets, and food items.
*   **`health_records`:** Tracks key health metrics over time, such as weight, body condition score, and any observed symptoms.

The database was implemented in MySQL 8.0, and PHP's PDO extension was used for all database interactions to prevent SQL injection vulnerabilities.

### 4.2 Backend Development: The Core Logic

The backend, developed in PHP 8.2, forms the core of the ANMS. It is responsible for user authentication, data processing, and, most importantly, the implementation of the nutrition recommendation algorithm.

**[Placeholder for Algorithm Flowchart: A flowchart illustrating the logic of the hybrid nutrition recommendation algorithm.]**

The backend exposes a RESTful API that the frontend consumes. Key API endpoints include:

*   `/api/users`: For user registration, login, and profile management.
*   `/api/pets`: For creating, retrieving, updating, and deleting pet profiles.
*   `/api/foods`: For searching and retrieving food information.
