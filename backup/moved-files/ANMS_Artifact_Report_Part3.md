Session management testing validates secure cookie configuration, proper timeout handling, and protection against session fixation attacks. JWT token implementation demonstrates proper signing, expiration handling, and secure transmission.

Multi-factor authentication foundations are validated through extensible authentication architecture supporting future enhancement with additional security factors. Account lockout mechanisms protect against brute force attacks while providing appropriate user recovery procedures. Password reset functionality implements secure token generation and validation with appropriate expiration handling.

**Input Validation and Sanitization**: Comprehensive input validation testing confirms protection against SQL injection attacks through exclusive use of prepared statements and parameterized queries. Cross-site scripting (XSS) protection testing validates proper output encoding and input sanitization across all user input fields. Cross-site request forgery (CSRF) protection demonstrates effective token validation for state-changing operations.

File upload security testing confirms proper file type validation, size limitations, and malware scanning capabilities. Data validation testing ensures all user inputs undergo appropriate type checking, range validation, and format verification. Error handling testing confirms sensitive system information remains protected while providing helpful user guidance.

HTTPS enforcement ensures encrypted communication for all sensitive operations. Database security testing confirms proper access controls and connection encryption.

Audit logging captures security-relevant events including authentication attempts, authorization failures, and administrative actions while protecting user privacy. Vulnerability scanning identifies no critical security issues with all identified concerns addressed through appropriate mitigation measures. Penetration testing validates overall system security posture with no successful exploitation attempts.
