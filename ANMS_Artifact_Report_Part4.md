### 5.2 Limitations and Areas for Improvement

While the artifact successfully demonstrates core concepts and functionality, several limitations represent opportunities for future development and enhancement. These limitations reflect the scope constraints identified in Phase 1 while highlighting paths for continued research and development.

**Algorithmic Sophistication**: The current implementation establishes foundations for nutrition planning but lacks the advanced machine learning capabilities envisioned in Phase 1 research. The rule-based approach provides transparency and safety but limited personalization compared to hybrid systems incorporating machine learning algorithms. Future development should integrate predictive analytics and personalized recommendation engines based on user data and health outcomes.

The nutrition calculation engine requires expansion to support more sophisticated dietary analysis including micronutrient tracking, ingredient-level analysis, and condition-specific dietary modifications. Integration with comprehensive food databases and nutritional analysis tools would enhance recommendation accuracy and relevance.

**Scalability Considerations**: The current single-server deployment model may require architectural modifications for larger user bases and increased system load. Database scaling strategies including replication, partitioning, and migration to more robust database systems should be considered for production deployment. Caching layers and content delivery networks would improve performance for geographically distributed users.

Load balancing and horizontal scaling capabilities require implementation for high-availability production environments. Monitoring and alerting systems need enhancement for proactive system management and performance optimization. Backup and disaster recovery procedures require expansion for enterprise-level reliability requirements.

**Integration Capabilities**: The system currently operates as a standalone platform with limited integration capabilities for external systems and devices. IoT device integration for automatic data collection from smart feeders, activity trackers, and health monitoring devices represents significant enhancement opportunities. API expansion for third-party integrations including veterinary practice management systems and pet food manufacturer databases would increase system utility.

Mobile application development for iOS and Android platforms would expand accessibility and user engagement. Push notification systems for health alerts, feeding reminders, and appointment notifications would improve user adherence and system value.

### 5.3 Lessons Learned and Development Insights

The artifact development process provides valuable insights into digital health technology development, user-centered design implementation, and academic project management within constrained timeframes and resources.

Modern web technologies including HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript ES6+ provide sufficient capabilities for complex user interface development with responsive design and accessibility compliance. The modular architecture approach facilitates testing, debugging, and future enhancement while maintaining code quality and maintainability.

**Development Methodology Effectiveness**: The modified Agile approach adapted for academic constraints proves effective for iterative development with regular milestone validation. Sprint-based development enables consistent progress tracking while accommodating changing requirements and scope adjustments. The focus on core functionality first ensures delivery of working systems while establishing foundations for future enhancement.

Quality assurance processes including comprehensive testing strategies prove essential for system reliability and user confidence. The multi-layered testing approach identifies issues early in development cycles, reducing overall development time and improving final system quality.

**User-Centered Design Validation**: The progressive disclosure approach successfully manages interface complexity while maintaining functionality and professional appearance. User feedback integration throughout development cycles ensures system alignment with actual user needs and preferences. Accessibility-first design approaches prove more efficient than retrofitting accessibility features after initial development.

The importance of comprehensive user research and stakeholder analysis becomes evident through development challenges and user feedback. Future projects would benefit from expanded user research including longitudinal studies and diverse demographic representation.

### 5.4 Future Development Roadmap
