# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature involves analyzing the current ANMS (Animal Nutrition Management System) codebase to identify and safely remove or relocate files and folders that don't serve the core project functionality. The goal is to create a cleaner, more maintainable project structure while preserving all essential functionality and providing a safety mechanism to recover any accidentally moved files.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to analyze the current codebase structure so that I can identify which files and folders are essential to the project's core functionality.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the analysis is performed THEN the system SHALL categorize all files and folders into essential, non-essential, and uncertain categories
2. WHEN categorizing files THEN the system SHALL consider active usage, dependencies, and functional importance
3. WHEN analyzing the codebase THEN the system SHALL identify duplicate files, test files, backup files, and documentation files
4. WHEN the analysis is complete THEN the system SHALL generate a comprehensive report of findings

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to safely move non-essential files to a backup location so that I can clean up the project structure without losing any potentially important files.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN moving files THEN the system SHALL create a backup directory structure that mirrors the original organization
2. WHEN files are moved THEN the system SHALL maintain the original directory structure within the backup folder
3. WHEN moving files THEN the system SHALL log all moved files with their original and new locations
4. WHEN the backup process is complete THEN the system SHALL provide a manifest of all moved files

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to preserve all essential project files so that the core functionality remains intact after cleanup.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN identifying essential files THEN the system SHALL preserve all active source code files
2. WHEN identifying essential files THEN the system SHALL preserve all database migration files
3. WHEN identifying essential files THEN the system SHALL preserve all configuration files required for the application
4. WHEN identifying essential files THEN the system SHALL preserve all dependency management files (composer.json, package.json, etc.)
5. WHEN identifying essential files THEN the system SHALL preserve all active CSS and JavaScript files used by the application

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to easily restore files from backup if needed so that I can recover any accidentally moved essential files.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN files need to be restored THEN the system SHALL provide a mechanism to restore individual files or entire directories
2. WHEN restoring files THEN the system SHALL restore them to their original locations
3. WHEN restoring files THEN the system SHALL handle conflicts if files already exist in the target location
4. WHEN restoration is complete THEN the system SHALL update the backup manifest to reflect the changes

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to identify and handle different types of non-essential files appropriately so that the cleanup process is thorough and organized.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN analyzing files THEN the system SHALL identify test files, debug files, and temporary files for potential removal
2. WHEN analyzing files THEN the system SHALL identify documentation files and reports that may be archived
3. WHEN analyzing files THEN the system SHALL identify backup files and duplicate files for consolidation
4. WHEN analyzing files THEN the system SHALL identify unused assets and legacy code for review
5. WHEN analyzing files THEN the system SHALL identify development tools and scripts that may not be needed in production

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to maintain project functionality after cleanup so that the application continues to work as expected.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN cleanup is complete THEN all core application functionality SHALL remain operational
2. WHEN cleanup is complete THEN all database connections and migrations SHALL continue to work
3. WHEN cleanup is complete THEN all API endpoints SHALL remain functional
4. WHEN cleanup is complete THEN all user interfaces SHALL continue to load and function properly
5. WHEN cleanup is complete THEN all authentication and authorization SHALL remain intact
