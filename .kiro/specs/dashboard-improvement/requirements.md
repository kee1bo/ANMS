# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The current ANMS dashboard contains multiple components and features that are either static, poorly connected to APIs, or inconsistently implemented across different pages. This feature aims to create a unified, dynamic dashboard that provides a comprehensive overview of all pet management features while ensuring proper API integration and consistent user experience.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a pet owner, I want a centralized dashboard that dynamically displays real-time information about all my pets, so that I can quickly understand their current status and take necessary actions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I access the dashboard THEN the system SHALL display real-time statistics including total pets, meals today, health scores, and upcoming checkups
2. WHEN pet data changes THEN the dashboard statistics SHALL automatically update without requiring a page refresh
3. WHEN I have no pets THEN the dashboard SHALL display appropriate empty states with clear calls-to-action to add pets
4. WHEN API calls fail THEN the dashboard SHALL display fallback data or appropriate error messages without breaking the interface

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a pet owner, I want the dashboard to show recent activity across all features, so that I can track what has been happening with my pets' care.

#### Acceptance Criteria

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I view the dashboard THEN the system SHALL display quick action buttons for adding pets, planning meals, logging health data, and viewing reports
2. WHEN I click a quick action button THEN the system SHALL open the appropriate modal or navigate to the correct feature
3. WHEN a quick action requires a pet selection THEN the system SHALL automatically populate available pets or prompt me to add one
4. WHEN I complete a quick action THEN the dashboard SHALL update to reflect the changes

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a pet owner, I want the dashboard to integrate seamlessly with all existing features (nutrition calculator, meal planner, health tracking, photo management), so that I have a unified experience across the application.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I access nutrition features from the dashboard THEN the system SHALL maintain context and return me to the dashboard after completion
2. WHEN I use the meal planner THEN the dashboard SHALL reflect scheduled meals in the statistics
3. WHEN I log health data THEN the health score on the dashboard SHALL update accordingly
4. WHEN I upload photos THEN they SHALL appear in the recent activity feed

### Requirement 5

2. WHEN I interact with dashboard elements THEN they SHALL respond within 200ms for local actions
3. WHEN loading data from APIs THEN the system SHALL show loading states and complete within 3 seconds
4. WHEN the dashboard loads THEN it SHALL be fully functional within 2 seconds on standard internet connections

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a pet owner, I want the dashboard to provide intelligent insights and recommendations based on my pets' data, so that I can make informed decisions about their care.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN pets have upcoming checkups THEN the dashboard SHALL display prominent reminders with scheduling options
2. WHEN pets' health metrics indicate concerns THEN the system SHALL show appropriate alerts and recommendations
3. WHEN nutrition plans are due for updates THEN the dashboard SHALL suggest recalculation based on pet age or weight changes
4. WHEN pets haven't had recent activity logged THEN the system SHALL provide gentle reminders to update their information

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a pet owner, I want the dashboard to maintain consistent visual design and interaction patterns with the rest of the application, so that I have a cohesive user experience.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I navigate between dashboard and other features THEN the visual design SHALL remain consistent

4. WHEN using the dashboard on different screen sizes THEN the responsive behavior SHALL match other pages

### Requirement 8

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN API endpoints are unavailable THEN the dashboard SHALL display cached data with appropriate indicators
