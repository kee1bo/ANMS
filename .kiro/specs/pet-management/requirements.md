# Pet Management System Requirements

## Introduction

The Pet Management System is the foundational feature of ANMS that enables users to create, manage, and maintain detailed profiles for their pets. This system serves as the data foundation for all other features including nutrition planning, health tracking, and reporting. The system must handle multiple pets per user, comprehensive pet data, and provide intuitive management interfaces.

This feature directly supports the research project's goal of creating personalized animal nutrition plans by capturing the essential pet characteristics needed for accurate nutritional calculations and health monitoring.
