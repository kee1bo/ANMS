Can I use Generative AI tools?
Basic spelling and grammar correction tools are permitted.
The following originality requirements will apply to this assignment:
You are allowed to use any Generative AI or other AI powered tools, such as ChatGPT, for specific aspects as directed
by the Unit Leader. Where any part of your assessment is sourced, or partially sourced from a generative AI tool, this
requires a reference in the BU Harvard style.
Task:
1. Introduction
You are required to produce a 6,000-word dissertation of academic quality, based on independent research that includes an
artefact of up to 5,000 words or the equivalent of efforts (please see Project Handbook). In the dissertation, you will
demonstrate your ability to identify and systematically study a problem as well as select, implement, and evaluate an
appropriate approach to solving the problem. The subject of your project must be related to your degree title, and to the
outcomes of that title. More information is provided in the Project Handbook.
2. Valid Artefact
All projects are expected to produce an artefact. An artefact is defined as a self-existing product of the project with a view to
subsequent use. Your project involves the research, design, implementation, and evaluation of an artefact that solves a
particular problem and answers novel research questions relevant to your course of study. In other words, a project should
have an artefact as a technical solution to the related problem. You may build an artefact or write an artefact based on the
valid project definition for your degree title. If you write an artefact, you must make sure the artefact is actionable, which
means the artefact can be exploited technically. For more details on artefacts related to your degree, please see Section 3 of
the Handbook.

4. Supervisory Meetings
Typically, you meet with your supervisor for continuous support. There may be some changes to this based on supervisor
availability, but it is your responsibility to liaise with your supervisor and attend all meetings scheduled to discuss milestones
(Project kick-off, Background study and Methodology, Mid Review and halfway point, Artefact demo, results and discussion,
Draft review, and feedback). Should you not be able to make a meeting, you should email your supervisor as soon as possible
explaining why, and rescheduling where possible. Missing two meetings without any contact with your supervisor will result
in the instigation of the formal attendance process which can lead to withdrawal from the course.
5. Citing Sources and Plagiarism
All work submitted for this project should represent your own original contribution. This includes written content and any
source code you develop, except where you make appropriate and clear use of external sources or tools. Any use of secondary
sources (such as literature, data, or existing code) must be properly cited using the BU Harvard referencing style:
http://libguides.bournemouth.ac.uk/bu-referencing-harvard-style. You should also ensure you understand what constitutes
plagiarism: https://libguides.bournemouth.ac.uk/study-skills-referencing-plagiarism
References must be included both within the text and in the final reference list. If you use Generative AI tools for any part of
your work, including code, see Section 6 for specific guidance on disclosure. If in doubt, speak with your Project Supervisor or
the Project Coordinator.
6. Originality and Use of Generative AI
In addition to properly citing your sources, you are permitted to use Generative AI (gAI) and other AI-powered tools (e.g.,
ChatGPT, Copilot, DALL·E, Grammarly) as part of your project work. However, any use of these tools must be clearly and
appropriately disclosed. This guidance aligns with professional standards in computing and engineering disciplines. If you use
AI tools to generate or significantly enhance any part of your dissertation—such as text, code, figures, tables, citations, data
analysis, or images—you must briefly explain how and where the tools were used. Disclosure should be included in a visible
section of your work, such as the Acknowledgments, Original Work Declaration, or Methodology.
For example: “ChatGPT was used to assist in generating summaries for the literature review and for improving clarity in the
Discussion section.” Where possible, be specific. For example: “GitHub Copilot was used during initial prototyping (Section 4.2). All
output was reviewed, tested, and edited prior to inclusion.”
You must also make it clear what work is your own and what has been generated or heavily assisted by AI tools—particularly
in the methodology and any artefact appendix. Failure to disclose such use may be treated as an academic offence, in the
Jun 2025 - v2 **

same way that undeclared copying or plagiarism would be. Use of tools for spelling, grammar, or minor language
improvements (e.g., MS Word’s spelling checker, Grammarly) does not require detailed disclosure if used for routine editing. 
Intended Learning Outcomes (ILOs)
This unit assesses your ability to:
1. Demonstrate knowledge and understanding which is appropriate to the subject area and the ability to handle

All projects are double marked. The first marker is normally your supervisor. The second marker is another academic. Both
markers assess your project independently. Only once the project has been read and marked by both assessors independently
do they get together to discuss your project and agree on a final mark. A sample of work, normally including all Firsts and
Fails, as well as a selection of other work, will be externally moderated by both the external examiner and the quality
manager. You will not be able to receive the mark until after the meeting of the Assessment Board. Dates of the Assessment
Board for your programme are available from your Programme Support Office (PSO) and are published on Brightspace.
3. Feedback Method
Detailed feedback and your mark will be uploaded onto Brightspace normally within the period specified in the University
Regulations.
