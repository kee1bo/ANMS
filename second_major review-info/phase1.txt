Animal Nutrition Management System
Abstract
The complexity of animal nutritional requirements presents significant challenges for caregivers across all sectors, from pet owners to veterinary professionals. This dissertation presents the research, design, and development of a comprehensive web-based Animal Nutrition Management System (ANMS) that bridges the gap between sophisticated nutritional science and practical implementation. The system employs a hybrid algorithmic approach combining rule-based systems with machine learning capabilities to generate personalized diet plans based on individual animal characteristics. Using PHP, MySQL, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript technologies, the ANMS integrates comprehensive nutritional databases, real-time monitoring capabilities, and educational components within an intuitive user interface. The methodology employs an iterative development approach with continuous user feedback integration, ensuring the system meets diverse stakeholder needs while maintaining scientific accuracy. This research contributes to digital animal health technology by providing a scalable, accessible solution that democratizes access to evidence-based nutritional guidance.
1. Introduction
1.1 Context and Problem Statement
Animal nutrition represents a critical factor in maintaining health, welfare, and longevity across millions of animals in domestic, agricultural, and shelter environments. Despite significant advances in nutritional science, a substantial implementation gap exists between sophisticated research findings and practical application by caregivers. This gap manifests across multiple dimensions: knowledge accessibility, recommendation personalization, monitoring integration, and educational support.
The global animal nutrition market, valued at USD 24.26 billion in 2023 and projected to reach USD 42.48 billion by 2032, reflects growing demand for precision nutrition solutions (Newstrail, 2025). However, current digital tools remain fragmented, serving either basic consumer needs with generic recommendations or professional requirements with complex, expensive systems requiring specialized training.
Modern animal nutrition science recognizes that optimal feeding strategies must account for multiple interacting factors creating highly individualized requirements. Research demonstrates that precision nutrition approaches can improve health outcomes by up to 35% compared to traditional population-based strategies (Verschoor et al., 2023). Yet implementing such sophisticated approaches requires knowledge and computational systems typically beyond most caregivers' reach.

    • Knowledge improvement demonstration of 70% or greater in assessment comparisons
    • User confidence increases of 75% or greater in self-reported measures
    • Behavioral change documentation showing 60% or greater recommendation adherence
    • Long-term engagement maintenance with 70% user retention after 30 days
This comprehensive methodology ensures systematic development and rigorous evaluation of the ANMS while maintaining academic standards and practical relevance for diverse stakeholders in animal nutrition management.
